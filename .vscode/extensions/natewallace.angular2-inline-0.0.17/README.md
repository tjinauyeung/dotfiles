## angular2-inline

*This extension replaces the language-vscode-javascript-angular2 extension.*

This package is a language extension for Microsoft Visual Studio Code.  It extends the javascript and
typescript languages to add Angular2 specific features for inline templates and stylesheets.
When you define an inline template or inline style sheet using the backtick character(`` ` ``) the
content will be processed by this extension.

The features provided by this extension:
* Syntax highlighting of inline html and css.
* Code completion, highlighting, and hover information for inline html.

Below is an example of what the colorizer looks like in action.

the [vscode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) project.
